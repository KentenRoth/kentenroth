Hi 👋, My name is Kenten Roth

Web Developer
-------------

In 2021 I made the career change from working on cars to becoming a web developer.  My day-to-day coding at work is using WordPress, and PHP.  When it comes to things I build at home I use React, Typescript, and JavaScript.  I am currently teaching myself C#, because I want to transition from a front-end developer to a software developer.

* 🌍  I'm based in Iowa
* 🖥️  See my portfolio at [My Portfolio](http://kentenroth.dev)
* 🚀  I'm currently working on a small SaSS project for a Client Acquisition web app. 
* 🧠  I'm learning C#
* ⚡  I am currently training for a marathon, but I want to run an ultra marathon.

### Skill
React, TypeScript, JavaScript, SASS, MongoDB, SQL, and currently learning C#
